                <h3>3.2 Hardware requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    Supported devices:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Desktop PCs</li>
                        <li>Laptops</li>

                        <li>Mobile phones</li>
                        <li>Embedded software (granted that access to a web browser is supported)</li>
                    </ul>
                    Regardless of the type of device used, the user will be required to have a working display and a web browser installed and a pointing/clicking solution (be it a mouse or a touchscreen interface). No hardware limitations are enforced (the software will make use of the CPU's, GPU's and computer memory's capabilities).

                <h3>3.4 Communication requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    As stated in earlier requirements, the end user will need acces to a web browser in order for the application to be displayed. Communication between the client and the server will be made through the use of the HTTP communication standard. Data which will be manipulated by the back-end will be JSON compliant (e.g. key-value pairs). Dynamically changing content will be handled according to Ajax norms.
